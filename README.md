# BookHaven
A simple online bookstore web application created for my CS Diploma FYP

Steps to run the application
1. Install XAMPP
2. Copy all the files in the repository except the bookhaven(5).sql file, then place in a single folder(you can name this BookHaven for simplicity or any other name)
3. Run the Apache and MySQL client
4. Import the SQL code into the MySQL client
5. Voila the application should be up and running
6. Congratulations, you just copied this for your FYP right?
